My father doesn’t say “I love you,” but he always picks me up, even at 2 a.m. on a random Thursday.

My mother doesn’t say “I love you,” but she always makes me milk tea or Vietnamese iced coffee in the morning because she knows I love it.

My father isn’t the most gentle person, but he’ll stay up until midnight, glued to the TV, waiting for me to come home, just to see me slam my bedroom door without a word.

My mother isn’t the softest either, but she’ll listen to me vent about all the things I need to do this week, always checking if there’s anything she can do to help.

My father doesn’t spoil me, but he’ll ask about my grades. It’s annoying, but it’s his way of showing he cares.

My mother doesn’t give me everything I want, but she never forgets to bring back something when she visits Milan with her friends.

My parents’ words can cut deep, but they’re the only criticism I trust.

They didn’t shower me with affection or coddle me growing up, but that taught me resilience.

They may not be the sweetest parents, but I’m not the sweetest son either.

After years of knowing, tolerating, and arguing with each other, I’ve come to understand a language that not many can — the language my parents speak.
