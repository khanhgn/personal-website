I have been told often that **failure is just part of life**, that it is just part of human nature. Yet, **some of us cannot afford to fail**. To those who do not have the luxury of choices, our future hinges on the one chance we were given.

**There is no back up plan. I am the back up plan.**

Ever since I was 2 years old, I was told that the hopes and dreams of my family **are held firmly in my hands**. We did not have much, and as the first son of an immigrant family, **failure was never an option** for me.

Every time my mates say *"your grades do not define you"* or *"grades are just numbers,"* I wonder, **how can someone have such a luxury?** My grades are not only a measure of my academic abilities. **They are my one and only ticket for my family.** They are literally the bridge between where I am and where I want to be.

I've always tried to be the **perfect child**: good ATAR, perfect GPA, always engaged in lots of extracurricular activities. But recently, **failure has a way of creeping in**. *Why am I like this?* *Why did I answer that on the assignment?* *Am I investing my time into the right people?* These questions keep me up at night. But to those who are in the same shoes as me - **we are all humans. Let's try again!** Remember why you cannot afford to fail but also **celebrate the small victories** and reflect on your failures. Because those moments are always steps toward your goals.

Recently, I have been realizing that **failure is a victory in itself**. If anyone else is striving against the odds - **I am proud of you.**

**Even if all you did today was survive, keep going!**
