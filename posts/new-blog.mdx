title: Why do I feel this way?

I often stop for a second to ponder what might happen to my life this week. As the first son of an immigrant family who is largely struggling with money, my only goal ever in life was to get money.

But my perspective has been changing recently. Like many other undergraduate students, my goal was always to get into Big Tech and live a decent life. I guess a life that my parents couldn't afford. But this has been pushing many others like my self down an extreme. Pursuing internships made me realise how impactful they are but at a cost of my mental health and physical wellbeing. Not only that, I have isolated myself from my family, from my friend and even worse from my partner and my self.

I'm not saying this is a direct causation with the stress of being rejected by Jane Street and Optiver but rather it is an accumulation of things that have been happening in my life: uni exams, uncertainty of the future, student debt, mortgage, clubs, moving and taking on too many responsibilities. I am writing this to encourage those in the same position as me to take a step back and understand very clearly what you **need** to prioritise rather than want to. We all start and end at different points, so don't feel the pressure to pursue Big Tech.

My bad habbits has gotten to the breaking point as I am unable to produce my own thoughts. I realised how much time I am spending on things like YouTube and podcasts without leaving much room for my own voices. Not to mention the anxiety and negative loop cycle that came with this experience. For the past 5 months, my life has been something like me delving into every single bad habbit that I wanted to break after a negative experience that needs coping with (this is usually me failing interviews). 

So something needs to be changed. And here's what I am going to do:
1. Sleep is very messed up - I need to get more than 8 hours of sleep
2. Spend dedicated time blocks towards meaningful things (for me this is 5.30-7.30 am for reading and studying ML)
3. Eating healthy and full meals
4. Spend more time with my love ones
5. Build consistency rather than short busts of intensity 

Here is what my day is going to look like:
- wake up around 5 am
- study/research 5.30-7.30 am
- drop my brother off at school 7.40 - 8.40 am
- the part where I handle life and uni (will need to time block this)
- sleep routine 8.30 pm
- sleep by 9.15 pm
