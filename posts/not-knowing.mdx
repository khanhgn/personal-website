Have you ever found yourself in that unsettling space where not knowing something gnaws at you? That lingering ache of uncertainty, pulling at the edges of your thoughts? **I know that feeling all too well.**

I've always had this relentless drive to understand everything—every detail, every nuance. It's been with me for as long as I can remember. But it wasn't until I hit that point in life where survival mode kicks in that I realized just how deeply this need to know has shaped me.

Socially, it's been a double-edged sword. I wouldn't say I'm a people pleaser, but this urge to know often nudges me in that direction. I find myself constantly checking in with the people around me—how they’re feeling, what’s been bothering them—not just to connect, but because I need to know. But sometimes, **knowing too much leaves me wounded**.

Lately, I’ve pulled back, isolating myself because the weight of knowing everything has become too much. I used to think I needed all the answers, but now I’m realizing that sometimes, it’s okay not to know. **It’s about protecting my peace.**

*If they want to reply to you, they would.*  
*If you’re meant to be accepted, you will be.*  
*If you are good enough, someone will see that.*

It’s tough to let go of the need to control every outcome, but I’m slowly accepting that **we can’t force things to happen**.

Letting go of the need to know everything is hard. It feels unnatural, like I’m pretending not to care. But maybe, just maybe, **I can fake it until I finally believe it.**
